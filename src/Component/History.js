    <h1 className='h1' align="center"> History of React js </h1>
    <p className='p'>React.js is one of the most popular front-end development frameworks in the world. It is used by companies of all sizes, from startups to Fortune 500 companies, to build high-performance and scalable web applications.
    </p>
    <h2 className='h2'>But how did React.js get started? And what has made it so popular?</h2>
    <p className='p'>The story of React.js begins in 2010, when Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, created an early prototype of React.js called "FaxJS." Walke was inspired by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. He wanted to create a similar library for JavaScript that would make it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces.</p>
   <p className='p'>In 2011, React.js was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed. It was later deployed on Instagram in 2012. In 2013, React.js was open-sourced to the public.</p>
    <p className='p'>
   <b> Since then, React.js has become one of the most popular front-end development frameworks in the world. It is used by companies of all sizes to build high-performance and scalable web applications.

   <h2 className='h2'>Here are some of the key reasons why React.js is so popular:</h2>
   <ul className='ul'>
   <h3 className='h3'> <li>Component-based architecture:</li>
    <li>Virtual DOM:</li>
